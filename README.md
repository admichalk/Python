1. Predicting Breast Cancer (Classification)
Traditionally, breast cancer has been diagnosed using invasive surgical procedures. However, techniques, such as image processing of just a single drop of specimen (fluid taken from the breast tumor) paired with machine learning, has dramatically decreased the need for full biopsies.
This project will demonstrate the aforementioned technique by processing measurements of 569 photos.
