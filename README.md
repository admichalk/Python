1. Predicting Breast Cancer (Classification)

Traditionally, breast cancer has been diagnosed using invasive surgical procedures. However, techniques, such as image processing of just a single drop of specimen (fluid taken from the breast tumor) paired with machine learning, has dramatically decreased the need for full biopsies.
This project will demonstrate the aforementioned technique by processing measurements of 569 photos.


2. Profiling Credit Card Customers (Cluster Visualization and Interpretation)

Customer segmentation is a marketing strategy performed to group customers into subgroups based on consumer characteristics. Doing so can help companies understand their customers more deeply, improve customer experience, and increase sales. In this project, we will be performing customer segmentation using agglomerative clustering. The data we will be using contains 18 features and 8950 credit card users variables.
